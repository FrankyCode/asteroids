# Asteroids
Asteroids game in Python

# Install and Config
> To follow best practice, I recommend using a virtual environment (venv) to keep the Python version of each library needed for this project separate from other Python projects.

### *With Virtual Environment*
1. To create one (venv) (at the top level of your project directory) use this code `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the (venv) with this code `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Check the pygame is installed: `python3 -m pygame`

> Once you have finished playing and closed the terminal, if you want to play again just remember to re-enable the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`) before executing main.py 

### *Without Virtual Environment*
- Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# How to play?
- Run the game with `python3 main.py`
- Use arrow keys or W/A/S/D for move the Spaceship
- Press space bar to shoot
